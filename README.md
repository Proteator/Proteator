# Proteator
A peptide mapping tool created at University of Freiburg.

Proteator extracts protein identifiers from an input file (comma or tab-separated or mzTab) and retrieves relevant data from Uniprot.

Peptides listed in the file can be mapped to the proteins which will be visually displayed along with topological features.
