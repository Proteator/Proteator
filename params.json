Upon input, data concerning sequence and topology of the proteins is retrieved from Uniprot, the peptides are mapped to their positions and the result is displayed in the web browser. \r\n\r\nProteator includes advanced analysis functionality such as visual display of fold changes or the ability to filter proteins for certain topological domains. \r\n\r\nThe finished visualization can be exported as .html file for ease of sharing.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
